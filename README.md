# HTTP-test-maker
A cli-tool for creating scripts, 
that test various http-endpoints in series.

## ToDo
- README

## How does it work
The test-maker has two modes, that work in tandem.
Firstly there is the cli-mode, where the user can input arguments.
Secondly this program will run an interactive user-input.
It will ask question, that the cli-commands did not fully provide.
